[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/PoParser.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/PoParser)

A Ruby PO file parser, editor and generator. PO files are translation files generated by GNU/Gettext tool. This GEM is compatible with [GNU PO file specification](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/PO-Files.html). report misbehaviours and bugs, to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/arashm/PoParser/issues).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'poparser'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install poparser

## Usage

Working with the GEM is pretty easy:

```ruby
path = Pathname.new('example.po')
po   = PoParser.parse(path)
=> <PoParser::Po, Translated: 68.1% Untranslated: 20.4% Fuzzy: 11.5%>
```

The `parse` method returns a `PO` object which contains all `Entries`:

```ruby
# get all entries
po.entries # or .all alias

# include cashed entries (started with "#~", these
# entries are just kept by program for later use and are
# not counted as active entries)
po.entries(true)

# get all fuzzy entries
po.fuzzy

# get all untranslated entries
po.untranslated

# get all translated entries
po.translated

# returns a hash representation of the PO file
po.to_h

# returns a string representation of the PO file
po.to_s
```

You can add a new entry to the PO file:

```ruby
new_entry = {
              translator_comment: 'comment',
              refrence: 'refrence comment',
              msgid: 'untranslated',
              msgstr: 'translated string'
            }

po.add(new_entry)

# There's also an alias for add `<<`
po << new_entry
```

You can pass an array of hashes to `new_entry` and it will be added to `PO` file.

### Entry

Each entry can have following properties (for more information see [GNU PO file specification](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/PO-Files.html)):

```
translator_comment
refrence
extracted_comment
flag
previous_untraslated_string
cached
msgid
msgid_plural
msgstr
msgctxt
```

#### Working with entries

The `PO` object contains many `Entry` objects. Number of methods are available to check state of the `Entry`:

```ruby
entry = po.entries[1]

entry.untranslated? # or .incomplete? alias
#=> false
entry.translated? # or .complete? alias
#=> true
entry.fuzzy?
#=> true
entry.plural?
#=> false
```

You can get or edit each of property of the `Entry`:

```ruby
entry.msgid.to_s
#=> "This is an msgid that needs to get translated"
entry.translate = "This entry is translated" # or `msgstr=` alias
entry.msgstr.to_s
#=> "This entry is translated"
```

You can mark an entry as fuzzy:

```ruby
entry.flag_as_fuzzy
entry.fuzzy?
#=> true
```

It's possible to get Hash and String representation of the `Entry`:

```ruby
entry.to_h
entry.to_s(true)
```

### Searching

`PO` is an `Enumerable`. All exciting methods from `Enumerable` are available in `PO`. The `PO` yields `Entry`.

```ruby
po.find_all do |entry|
  entry.msgid.str.match(/some text/i)
end
```

There is a helper method that does the same:

```ruby
po.search_in(:msgstr, 'some string to search')
```

This method returns an array of matched entries.

### Saving
You can simply save the PO file using the `PO` object:

```ruby
po.save_file
```

If you want to save as the file in diffrent location change the `path`:

```ruby
po.path
#=> example.po
po.path = 'example2.po'
po.save_file
```
